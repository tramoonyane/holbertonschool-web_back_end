Type Annotations in Python 3
Type annotations in Python 3 provide a way to specify the types of variables and function parameters within your code. They allow you to declare the expected types of variables and the arguments and return types of functions, enhancing code readability and enabling better static analysis.

Using Type Annotations
You can use type annotations by adding type hints to your code. For example, you can specify the type of a variable using a colon followed by the desired type. Similarly, you can specify function signatures by annotating parameters and return types. Type annotations are optional and do not affect the runtime behavior of the code, but they provide valuable information for static analysis tools and improve code documentation.

Duck Typing
Duck typing is a concept in Python where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. Instead of checking whether an object is of a specific type, duck typing focuses on whether an object behaves like the required type. This approach emphasizes the presence of specific methods or attributes rather than the object's inheritance hierarchy or explicit type.
